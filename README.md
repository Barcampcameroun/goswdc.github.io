## Overview
Project GOSWDC is the program website template that helps you to set up a mobile first event website with speakers and schedule management in a few minutes.

The template is created based on open-source software and team experience of running Techstars Startup Week programs and particpant feedback.

Our goal is to allow event organizers to set up professional conference website with minimum resources. To get started you need only basic knowledge of web technologies and a free Github account.

## Updating
Here is a git workflow for updating your fork (or downloaded copy) to the latest version:
```console

# resolve the merge conflicts in your editor
git add . -u
git commit -m 'Updated to the latest version'
```
